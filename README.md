# My Library
*This library contains most of the notes I take and resources I use to learn ML*

*I mostly use it to document my progress but it is also thought to be useful for someone looking for quality resources to understand both the theory behind ML and the implementation*

*This library is specially designed for someone intested in AI research*

*For the moment I complete the notebooks and problems from the following book!!*
## books : currently reading 
* "Understanding Deep Learning" — Simon J.D. Prince (2023)
* ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/progress%20-%20chapter%204%2F21-blue)

* "Convex Optimization" — Stephen Boyd & Lieven Vandenberghe 
* "The Elements of Statistical Learning" — Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman
  
*foundational ideas* :
* "Understanding Deep Learning" — Simon J.D. Prince (2023)
* "Deep Learning: Foundations and Concepts" — Christopher Bishop & Hugh Bishop

*going deeper in the math* :

encyclopedy : 
- "Deep Learning" from I.Goodfellow, Y.Bengio, A.Courville -> considered as an encyclopedy not good to learn from scratch with it
- "Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction" — Kevin Murphy (Vol 1)
